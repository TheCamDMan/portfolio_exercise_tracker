## Description

This is a web app developed using the MERN stack complete with a persistent non-relational database 
that allows the user to Create, Read, Update, and Delete exercise entries.

---

### How to Use

Once the program has been installed, start two terminals and navigate to exercise-rest and exercise-ui separately.  
Start both programs with npm start.
Click the link in the terminal of exercise-ui, or open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000

At first startup, the table will be empty. Click on the link to create an exercise, and fill in the fields.  
Press the button to create, a success message will display, and you will be redirected to the homepage.  
Here you will see a new entry in the database.  
  
To edit an entry, press the pencil icon in the row of the entry.  
To delete an entry, press the trashcan icon in the row of the entry.

## Background

This program was assigned to me during Web-Development as a portfolio project during my time at Oregon State University 
while pursuing my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science.  

This project was used to demonstrate understanding of how to use the Model, View, Controller development pattern to build a web app with Node, Express, and React.
For the assignment, we were given what the expectations were for data design, CRUD functions, and HTML pages. Everything else was left up to the student.
